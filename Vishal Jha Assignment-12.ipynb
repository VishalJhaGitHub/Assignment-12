    "#1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "#Exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted and the interpreter searches for an exception handler to deal with the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 - Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as attempting to divide by zero, accessing an index that is out of range, or calling a method on an object that does not support it. Python has a variety of built-in exception classes for handling these different types of errors, such as ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, and AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 - Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code because it violates the rules of the Python language. Examples of syntax errors include leaving out a colon at the end of a line when defining a function or misspelling a keyword like if or while."
